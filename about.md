I'm an Android developer. I've been working on Android since 2010. I've worked on games and applications for Android.

Some of the games I've worked on include [Millionaire City](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dchoc.dollars), [Zombie Lane](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dchoc) and [Hollywood City](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalchocolate.androidmovie).

I've worked on applications such as [Philips Smart Air](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.cl.di.dev.pa) which involved communicating with the Philips Smart Air purifier.

I'm starting this blog to keep track of my personal projects and to blog about uncommon stuff I find during my development.
